## Country Cornbread

Cornbread is a staple in the South. It is absolutely essential with bean dishes, black-eyed peas, greens, hearty stews, and, of course, country-style ribs. It's a cheap, filling dish that's easy to make from scratch and better than any boxed mix. Throughout the years, Southerners have enjoyed cornbread in many different ways, from fritters to corn pone and spoon bread to hush puppies. Despite all of those options, many believe that the best Southern cornbread is baked in a cast-iron pan so it gets a crispy crust.

Southern-style cornbread rarely contains sugar, though some regions and many people do like to sweeten their cornbread a bit. To add sugar or not can be a hot topic of debate, and it's an optional ingredient in this recipe. If you have Northerners and Southerners to cook for, you might have to look for compromise. Or make two pans!

This cornbread recipe doesn't require buttermilk. It's richer than most because it's made with three eggs, and using a combination of cornmeal and flour ensures it won't get too dry or crumbly.

### Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon vegetable shortening
- 2 cups yellow cornmeal
- 1 1/2 cups (or180 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup (or 2 ounces) unsalted butter
