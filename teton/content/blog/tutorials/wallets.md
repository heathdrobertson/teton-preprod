## Wallet tutorial

Sometimes you just need something small to get the job done. This mini wallet is one of those times. With a d-ring to attach to a lanyard, two pockets- one for change and one for cash and a small size to minimize bulk, this little project packs a big punch. Whether you want something to throw into a larger bag, a way for kiddos to keep track of their own cash or a small pouch to store your own cards and money this is the wallet for you. The Mini Wallet Tutorial will walk you through each of the steps, and includes three different closure options depending on your preferences and what you have on hand.
